A numeric type for large integer values that can serialize safely as JSON.

While JSON itself has no hard limit on the size of integers, the RFC-7159 spec
mentions that values outside of the range -9,007,199,254,740,991 (-(2^53) + 1)
to 9,007,199,254,740,991 (2^53 - 1) may not be interopable with all JSON
implementations. As it turns out, the number implementation used by JavaScript
has this issue. When you parse a JSON string that contains a numeric value like
`4693522397653681111`, the parsed result will contain a rounded value like
`4693522397653681000`.

While this is entirely a client-side problem, we want to preserve maximum compatibility
with common client languages. Given the ubiquity of GraphiQL as a GraphQL client,
we want to avoid this problem.

Our solution is to support two separate types:

- This type (`JsonSafeLong`) is serialized as a number, but limits values to the safely
  serializable range.
- The `LongString` type supports long values that use all 64 bits, but serializes as a
  string rather than a number, avoiding the JavaScript compatibility problems.

docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
